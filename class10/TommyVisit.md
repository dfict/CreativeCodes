https://www.openslr.org/resources.php different corpus 

btw, share the corpus with Deysi what's that website?

can i share this?

p5js and processing (javascript library for creative code) 
why p5js?
it's the web version of processing.
—it's cool because it's embedded on web URLS—
—web is EVERYWHERE
—immediately distributable on social media —not like an album that needs media transfer
—it's also really interesting because you can access data SUPER easily.
—live feed of data.
—also mobile. access everything in your phone.
—such as your phone's sensors—you can connect to cameras, accelerometers (gryo in phone), GPS, microphones

Tommy—who is he?
programmer/artist or artist/programmer
how does the role shift?
does the role shift with tech access?


work sample:
cool DJ track with sampler
"i always felt like i was afraid to make an album"
why?
"musicians are pressured to do things like that. i didn't want to"
"how to navigate dual indentity as a programmer?"
"web programming—web is a generative way to make *REAL TIME* music that happens 
guitar!!!! "Living Streams" indexes iterative and generative music that does not sound the same each time. it's different everytime you load. cool how it happens inside the browser, unlike max which is powerful but not USER specficic
cool that it's generative and ENDS at a specific time. it's not just generative and goes on FOREVER.
—looks like bandcamp page—in conversation with aesthetics of social media. 
the PLAYER is not a wav file. it collages. 
it has a list of sound files and it plays them.
45 different mp3 files.
and it corresponds to the counter and makes changes based on things 
living streams audio graphic —
*TOMMY CAN YOU share this page
so elegant

mesh of echoes
the other thing about web is using multiplicity
user must give permission
cool how many different sound sources there are. maybe shoul dhave big density?
could density be related to how many users there are?
side ffects from the piece
solves for easy multichannel. we all have synchronized soundfile playback for free if you have web.

btw—it's all open source. you could hack either of those pieces and make them how you sound.

american artist collab
a version of a piece you can play in real time
the audio is running through a process that a user can manipulate in real time
it'sa piece of music with a User interactive plugin.
kind of like kanye stem player
meant to be fun to play. fun to experiment with the way you hear music
yak bak!

maxine's piece
was really cool
the musical web week 2
or 3?

sampling and synthesis with p5.sound.js
and rnbo

secondlife as performance moduality
linden-scripts
pauline oliveros used second life as a whole methodology —a base for composition

"i'm not a visual artist"
"i'm not a programmer"
those 3 websites we use are *standardized*
web 1.0 was not standardized (my prof website)
