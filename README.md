**<u>AT 101: Creative Codes</u>**

<u>SYLLABUS IS SUBJECT TO REVISION DURING THE SEMESTER</u>

*Course Description:* This introductory course presents a wide range of
interdisciplinary art practices - music, visual art, and poetry - and
contextualizes them with (and against) paradigms in computer
programming. By focusing on thematic resonances, such as recursive
structure, physical computing, and object-oriented programming, the
intent of this course is for students to create meaning in working with
code, rather than approaching computers as a default solution to every
problem.

> This course provides a foundational introduction to music programming
> languages. Max MSP, SuperCollider, Python, and Processing and Open
> will be explored through hands-on and creative applications. Students
> will gain experience with interactive visual art, audio/music signal
> processing, and machine learning. 
>
> This course does not provide a thorough introduction to any single
> computing language. Rather, it expects an encourages a humanistic
> approach translating higher level concepts of art to lower and very
> low levels of applications specific to your intent.

Software **Max**

> <https://cycling74.com/>
>
> Max is an object-oriented programming language that makes easy
> prototyping of sound environments/instruments accessible without
> needing to learn to code on levels like JS or C. It is a type of
> coding language in its own way, but the coding is done primarily with
> virtual representations of wires. It’s very fun and many of my class
> demos will get you excited about what’s possible—download it and see
> what you can get working off the bat! 
>
> *Note: you can try Max for free for 30 days, and thereafter you’ll
> need to purchase it, or sign up for a monthly or yearly student
> subscription. It is affordable. Conn College has Max on every machine
> in the computer lab!*
>
> **Max comes with an extensive body of educational materials,
> tutorials, help files, and project examples that can easily be
> copy/pasted into your own sketches.** <u>Students will be expected to
> read and study Max / MSP tutorials on their own and learn the syntax
> of the software throughout the course of the semester!</u>

**Supercollider**

<https://supercollider.github.io/downloads.html>

> Supercollider is a platform for audio synthesis and algorithmic
> composition, used by musicians, artists and researchers working with
> sound. It is code-based, completely free, light in size, and a little
> hard to work with.
>
> **Spear**
>
> <https://www.klingbeil.com/spear/>
>
> Spear performs Fourier Analysis in sound files. This is free software
> that allows you to turn recordings into individual sine waves and
> edit/select them.
>
> **Audacity**
>
> <https://www.audacityteam.org/>
>
> Audacity is a basic editing program that is excellent for transforming
> individual sounds.
>
> **Python**
>
> Extremely powerful code based platform

Some possible code editors you could use:

**Visual Studio Code**

<https://code.visualstudio.com/>

Pretty! Organized.

**Sublime Text Editor**

<https://www.sublimetext.com/>

Simple. Easy.

> **Csound**
>
> [*https://github.com/dfict/clawyer*](https://github.com/dfict/clawyer)

A rather old school way of making sound with computers.

Hardware: <https://www.frommdesign.com/product/ad-1-dsp-dev-board>

AD-1 is a DSP development board based around an ESP32-s3 microcontroller
and an es8388 audio codec. Designed for experimenting with digital
audio, the AD-1 can generate sound on its own or manipulate incoming
stereo audio. This board costs around $50 and will be the basis for many
hardware projects.

**Grading Rubric**

**Grading Descriptions**

**Class Participation / Attendance 20%**

Class attendance is mandatory. We work and experiment in class.
Discussions, critiques lectures and demonstrations provide the basis for
the successful completion of projects, and they are difficult to
re-create outside of class. In order to participate, you must be in
attendance. You have one unexcused absence permitted for the semester.
Your final grade will drop by 4 points for each further unexcused
absence. More than four absences will result in a failing grade for the
course. You are expected to participate actively in class by asking
questions, bringing energy to discussions, and arriving with prepared
homework/projects. Independent motivation is expected.

**Weekly Corpus 20%**

Students are expected to keep a weekly audio “journal”. Every week,
students will collect/record/curate sound file collections. The
collections each week will total up to 5 minutes of sound (or more),
featuring at least 5 different recordings. (**ie**, Week 1, you record
five 1 minute recordings. Week 2, twelve 10 second recordings, and one 3
minute recording). It is expected that you carefully label these files
and keep good file management, in additional to normalizing audio and
trimming the beginning and endings of each file. You can record with a
high quality field recorder you borrow from the university, you can
record with your phone. You can also “sample” recordings found in the
wild (but are discouraged from sampling pop music.)

Some prompts will be provided to help simplify this task. But ultimately
you are encouraged to: **<u>make it your own</u>** and may disregard
time and file requirements as the semester goes on and you figure out
what your’e doing.

**Etudes / Homework 20%**

Short reading assignments or creative prompts will be assigned each
week. Students will be expected to complete them and come to class ready
to discuss their progress. You cannot “get ahead” of these assignments
by doing them all ahead of time—they are meant to be part of a weekly
practice that is customized to the flow of the class.

**Artist Presentation 20%**

Do a short research presentation on an artist or piece of art that
inspires you. 10 min. The purpose of this assignment is to aid the
development of your final project by creating an opportunity to research
something that interests you for your own creative purposes and research
agenda.

**Final Project 20%**

Make a creative thesis and execute it, utilizing your audio corpus. The
project may include video, audio, drawing, and must somehow utilize a
computational process to illuminate your corpus.

**AI Policy**

The use of Machine Learning tools such as ChatGPT and Claude are
permitted, generally. In some cases we will explore them deliberately.
In some instances you will be discouraged from using these tools. AI
represents a sea change for humanity. It also represents a paradigm
shift for pedagogy in digital literacy.

I expect you will want to use AI (ChatGPT and image generation tools, at
a minimum), in this class. In fact, some assignments will require it.
Learning to use AI is an emerging skill—be aware of its limits. If you
provide minimum effort prompts, you will get low quality results. You
will need to refine your prompts in order to get good outcomes. This
will take work.

Don’t trust any code that your AI provides you. You will be responsible
for any errors or omissions provided by the tool. AI is a tool, but one
that you need to acknowledge using. Please include a paragraph or
citation on any assignment that uses AI explaining what you used the AI
for and what prompts you used to get the results. Failure to do so is in
violation of the academic honesty policies.
